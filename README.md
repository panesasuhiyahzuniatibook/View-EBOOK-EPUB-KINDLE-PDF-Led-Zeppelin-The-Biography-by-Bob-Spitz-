Title: The rise and fall of the world‚Äôs greatest rock band
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2022
Review: After reading Bob Spitzer‚Äôs Beatles bio, I turned to this one. Led Zeppelin has always been one of my favorite bands and the bio was a testament to their greatness. We learn the backstory of the band, a brain child of guitar prodigy Jimmy Page who brought together three other uniquely talented musicians. The bio then swings back-and-forth between the making of their legendary albums and their equally legendary tours and concerts. We follow with fascination and disgust as this phenomenal quartet conquers the world, only to fall prey to all of the vices and clich√©s that characterize rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll bands. They wallow in drugs, sex, alcohol, and pure unadulterated narcissism. We learn a great deal about band manager Peter Grant, a mafioso type figure who managed to keep the band together and on tour by assembling a cast of villains to support their drug habits and strong arm anybody who was in their way. The bio is terribly bloated with repetitive descriptions of overindulgence in cocaine, sex and ultraviolence. But in between these are marvelous passages illuminating the genius of the band as they cut album after album. Finally there is the inevitable break up after a long slide into the sewer of drug abuse and alcoholism ending with John Bonham‚Äôs untimely and sad death. Page also ends up a sad parody of himself unable to maintain the high standards of his guitar playing after many years of drug abuse. Meanwhile Robert Plant and John Paul Jones watch as the band descends and their partners struggle with their abusive behaviors. Plant especially comes out as a lyrical and vocal genius, while Jones is the musical genius behind the orchestration of some of the band‚Äôs best songs including Kashmir. He‚Äôs also the mastermind behind the most underrated album In through the out door, which in my opinion is far better than it is given credit for. While as bloated as the band itself, this bio is a worthy slog through the career of the best rock band ever.

Title: The life and history of Led Helpline from beginning to the end.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2022
Review: If you are a Led Zepplin fan this book.is for you, from beginning to. the end of their tours this book will hold your interest, it's a good story but a long book depending on your reading speed.
I found the book very interesting, and I learned a lot about the band, their good times and bad. If you are interested give it a try. Peace to all of you out there!

Title: Fascinating book!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2022
Review: I was 16 when Led Zeppelin played Whole Lotta Love. The band members were a bit crazy in their habits (is a huge understatement). I was rivoted to the book quite a few times. It is long and gets a bit redundant about the musicians in the band and their never ending passion to write new material. It is what they do when on tour that will get ya and keep ya interested in the book. Also what their family lives were like as opposed to their antics abroad. Although they didn't cover much material about their family lives. It was interesting to me how they'd act when they saw their wives and family's when they returned from tours. They were not good boys at all. Pretty darn sinister in the way they treated underage women most of the time. Drug and alcohol binges were the theme of the day. Complete opposite from me. So it was an interesting read and I'm not a big reader of books. But read quite a bit, just not books.

Title: Interesting Read
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2023
Review: Was an okay read. I was a little shocked by the indifferent attitude of the author to some of the disturbing debauchery detailed in the books. Seems like the band and its crew were off the rails with how they treated the women. Would think the author would have been a little harder on their behavior.
